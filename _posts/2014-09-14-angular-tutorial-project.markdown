In this AngularJS Tutorial I am going to tell you how to build an AngularJS Web Application from scratch.
It will contain examples about many of the mostly used AngularJS components such as controllers, directives,
services etc.

While developing this web site I'll also use some other tools such as **bower** for package
management, **bootstrap** for css templates and grid system, **less** for style sheets and **grunt**
for code minification. So it will not be only an AngularJS tutorial but it will be a complete guide for
creating a web site from development to production. For quick introduction, I want to explain all of these shortly
at the end of the page.

In parallel, I'll also create a backend for this website with Go language with Google App Engine(GAE) and
it will be another tutorial which is connected with this tutorial.

The source code of the tutorials (for each post) will be kept on this [GitHub](https://github.com/eluleci/web-tutorial-project)
repository under its own branch. So you'll be able to see the development step by step.

<h3>Frameworks and Tools</h3>
<h5>AngularJS</h5>
AngularJS is a Javascript Web Application framework. It makes DOM manipulation and two-way data binding too easy.
If you've created web sites with PHP or Python you know how hard it is to manage the content dynamically.
Once you render the page, you need to create Javascript for making AJAX requests and handling the DOMs. But with
AngularJS you're rendering the page already with Javascript so it becomes really easy to handle dynamic changes.

<h5>Bower</h5>
Bower is a web optimised package-dependency management system. It keeps info of the dependencies and lets you download
them when needed.

<h5>Bootstrap</h5>
Bootstrap is the most popular HTML, CSS, and JS framework for developing responsive, mobile first projects on the web.

<h5>Less</h5>
Less is a CSS pre-processor, meaning that it extends the CSS language, adding features that allow variables, mixins,
functions and many other techniques that allow you to make CSS that is more maintainable, themable and extendable.

<h5>Grunt</h5>
Grunt automates the processes like code minification, compilation, unit testing, linting, etc.
